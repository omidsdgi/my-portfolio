            About Me
        </h2>

        <p>
            I'm a motivated front-end developer with practical experience in React and Next.js. I began my coding journey with multiple courses on Udemy and enhanced my skills through the Navax College bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the program, I successfully built 8 mini-projects and a fully functional e-commerce app. I'm experienced with API integration, React Hooks, SSR/CSR techniques, and always strive to write clean, maintainable code based on UI/UX designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a fast learner, effective communicator, and enjoy team collaboration. I'm constantly experimenting with new technologies and building real-world projects to sharpen my skills.
